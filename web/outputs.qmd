             Over the past decade, Brazil has seen a dramatic rise in the seizure of military‑style rifles—once a rarity outside Rio de Janeiro—across nearly every state, from Rio Grande do Norte and Bahia to São Paulo, where annual seizures quintupled between 2018 and 2024. These high‑powered weapons, which can fire accurately over a kilometer and penetrate body armor, have escalated the lethality of criminal-police confrontations and bolstered criminal groups’ territorial control. In addition to traditional smuggling routes and internal diversions—exacerbated by a 2019 regulation that allowed civilians to purchase up to 30 rifles under collector or sport‑shooter licenses—Brazil is now grappling with the proliferation of “ghost guns,” unmarked, home‑built firearms made with 3D printers or CNC machines and assembled from imported frames."), class="hover-info"),

Discussions will include issues related to the circulation, control, and effects of rifles on broad social processes that allow the modulation and reproduction of violence. The two roundtables will discuss the current dynamics of the circulation of weapons and how these dynamics fuel and transform armed violence in the region, as well as existing challenges for data production and analysis on arms flows and their control.<br/>
The seminar “Transnational Arms Flows in Latin America: Trends and Challenges” will be held on August 28th, 10:00h to 16:00h, in a hybrid format – at the IRI2 Auditorium (R. Marquês de São Vicente, 232 – Gávea) and via Zoom.<br/>
