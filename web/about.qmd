Titled “Mapping the Transnational Circulation and Control of Small Arms in Latin America”, this project tries to answer three questions:

-   How do small arms and light weapons (SALW), and specifically military-style firearms, circulate in Latin America?

-   How do different types of arms flow legally and illegally across national borders?

-   What are the main challenges for controlling these flows?

The funds provided by the Swiss Network for International Studies (SNIS), allowed us to assemble a team of experts from Switzerland, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico to zoom into the circulation of military-style firearms. The project defines military-style firearms as semi-automatic and fully automatic long guns with rifled barrels of certain calibres (such as 7.62 x 39 mm, 5.45 x 39 mm, 5.56 x 45mm, .223 Rem 7,62 x 54 mmR, or 7.62 x 51 mm) as well as machine guns.

First, the project gathers data on legal and illegal transnational flows of military-style firearms, drawing from various national and international sources.

Second, based on this data, the social, economic, and political dynamics entailed by those flows are analysed to explore questions such as:

The relative significance of military-style firearms as a category of SALW, analyzing their production, circulation, impacts, and cultural insertion in connection with the study of specific violent patterns in the region.

The political economy of flows involving state, non-state, and hybrid actors at various stages of this circulation, from weapons production to their use.

Third, the sociocultural dynamics that surround the perception of such weapons and that foster their proliferation among state and non-state actors are examined through an analysis of digital social interaction.

Finally, the project maps the control norms that regulate the transnational circulation of SALW in Latin America. It gathers and analyzes data on the adoption, incorporation and implementation of international and regional norms and national legislation regarding legal and illegal transnational flows, identifying main challenges and opportunities for bilateral and multilateral cooperation.

Through mixed-method pluridisciplinary research, the project aims to shed light on the significance of small arms in the persistence of violence in Latin America, as well as the possibilities of cooperation to reduce their damage.

# **Understanding Firearms Circulation and Control in Latin America**

## The Challenge: Firearms and Violence in Latin America

Latin America is one of the most violent regions in the world, with firearms playing a central role. [In 2021](https://www.smallarmssurvey.org/sites/default/files/SAS-IG-2024-Gender-GVD-EN.pdf), 45% of violent deaths worldwide were committed with firearms—this [percentage reached](https://www.smallarmssurvey.org/sites/default/files/resources/SAS-GVD-2023-update-FINAL_EN.pdf) 71% in South America and 68% in Central America. The circulation of small arms and light weapons fuels organized crime, sustains armed militias, and undermines both public safety and democratic processes.

However, despite their significant impact, there is limited assessment of how these weapons circulate across the region. Understanding their transnational trade routes, trafficking patterns, and the social mechanisms that reinforce their use is crucial to addressing the problem.

## **Our Focus: Military-Style Firearms**

This project specifically examines the circulation of military-style firearms. These weapons, once limited to state security forces, are increasingly found in the hands of non-state actors, including criminal organizations and private security companies. The blurred lines between legal trade and illicit trafficking—such as firearms purchased legally in the U.S. and later trafficked to Mexican criminal groups—further complicate control efforts.

Moreover, these weapons shape patterns of violence and territorial control across the region. Their restrictive regulations make diversion from security forces to private owners an important factor in their proliferation. Beyond their material impact, these weapons also hold significant cultural meaning, appearing in music, movies, and popular narratives as symbols of power and masculinity.
