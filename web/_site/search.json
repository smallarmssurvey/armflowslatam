    "text": "Titled “Mapping the Transnational Circulation and Control of Small Arms in Latin America”, this project tries to answer three questions:\n\nHow do small arms and light weapons (SALW), specifically military-style firearms, circulate in Latin America?\nHow do different types of arms flow legally and illegally across national borders?\nWhat are the main challenges for controlling these flows?\n\nThe funds provided by the Swiss Network for International Studies (SNIS), allowed us to assemble a team of experts from Switzerland, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico to zoom into the circulation of military-style firearms. The project defines military-style firearms as semi-automatic and fully automatic long guns with rifled barrels of certain calibres (such as 7.62 x 39 mm, 5.45 x 39 mm, 5.56 x 45mm, .223 Rem 7,62 x 54 mmR, or 7.62 x 51 mm) as well as machine guns.\nFirst, the project gathers data on legal and illegal transnational flows of military-style firearms, drawing from various national and international sources.\nSecond, based on this data, the social, economic, and political dynamics entailed by those flows are analysed to explore questions such as:\n\nThe relative significance of military-style firearms as a category of SALW, analyzing their production, circulation, impacts, and cultural insertion in connection with the study of violent patterns in the region.\nThe political economy of flows involving state, non-state, and hybrid actors at various stages of this circulation, from weapons production to their use.\n\nThird, the sociocultural dynamics that surround the perception of such weapons and that foster their proliferation among state and non-state actors are examined through an analysis of digital social interaction.\nFinally, the project maps the control norms that regulate the transnational circulation of SALW in Latin America. It gathers and analyzes data on the adoption, incorporation and implementation of international and regional norms and national legislation regarding legal and illegal transnational flows, identifying main challenges and opportunities for bilateral and multilateral cooperation."

These high‑powered weapons, which can fire accurately over a kilometer and penetrate body armor, have escalated the lethality of criminal-police confrontations and bolstered criminal groups’ territorial control. In addition to traditional smuggling routes and internal diversions—exacerbated by a 2019 regulation that allowed civilians to purchase up to 30 rifles under collector or sport‑shooter licenses—Brazil is now grappling with the proliferation of “ghost guns,” unmarked, home‑built firearms made with 3D printers or CNC machines and assembled from imported frames.\n\n\nMore about the blogpost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle\nThe role of Military-style Firearms in Mexico\n\n\nMore about the article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle\nThe Authorized Trade in Small Arms: Latin America in Global Context\n\n\nMore about the article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle\nBlind Fire: The Rise of Military-Style Firearms amid Regulatory Failures and Data Deficiency in Brazil\n\n\nMore about the article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedia\nMapping the Transnational Circulation and Control\nof Small Arms in Latin America\n\n\n\n\nMore about the project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedia\nThe anatomy of a rifle - circulation and control in Latin America\n\n\n\n\nMore about the project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent\nTransnational Arms Flows in Latin America: Trends and Challenges\n\nHow do small arms and light weapons flow across the borders of Latin America and its territories? On August 28th, 10:00h to 16:00h, IRI/PUC-Rio will bring together national and international experts to discuss contemporary trends and challenges linked to arms flows in Latin America.\nDiscussions will include issues related to the circulation, control, and effects of rifles on broad social processes that allow the modulation and reproduction of violence. The two roundtables will discuss the current dynamics of the circulation of weapons and how these dynamics fuel and transform armed violence in the region, as well as existing challenges for data production and analysis on arms flows and their control.\nThe seminar “Transnational Arms Flows in Latin America: Trends and Challenges” will be held on August 28th, 10:00h to 16:00h, in a hybrid format – at the IRI2 Auditorium (R. Marquês de São Vicente, 232 – Gávea) and via Zoom.\nThe event is held by IRI/PUC-Rio in collaboration with the Centre on Conflict, Development & Peacebuilding (CCDP/IHEID) and the Small Arms Survey, with the support of FAPERJ and the Swiss Network for International Studies (SNIS).\n\n\nMore about the event\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent\nDialogue “Arms Circulation and Control in Latin America”\n\nSmall arms play a central role in the patterns of political and criminal violence observed in Latin America and the rest of the world. Among the various types of firearms used in the region, rifles are a case study for examining the emergence of violent dynamics and identifying effective entry points for policy responses and international cooperation initiatives.\nIn celebration of its 10th anniversary, the Global South Unit for Mediation (GSUM) announces that registration is now open for the dialogue “Arms Circulation and Control in Latin America”, which will take place on Thursday, December 5, from 4pm to 6pm. The event will take place in person at the Digital Humanities Laboratory, Estrada da Gávea 50, Sala 302 Gávea/RJ.\nThe dialog will feature the participation of IRI/PUC-Rio professors Monica Herz, Luísa Cruz Lobato and Victória Santos, who will present the work of the project “Mapping the Transnational Circulation and Control of Small Arms in Latin America”, carried out with the support of the Swiss Network for International Studies (SNIS).\n\n\nMore about the event"

These weapons, once limited to state security forces, are increasingly found in the hands of non-state actors, including criminal organizations and private security companies. The blurred lines between legal trade and illicit trafficking—such as firearms purchased legally in the U.S. and later trafficked to Mexican criminal groups—further complicate control efforts.\nMoreover, these weapons shape patterns of violence and territorial control across the region. Their restrictive regulations make diversion from security forces to private owners an important factor in their proliferation. Beyond their material impact, these weapons also hold significant cultural meaning, appearing in music, movies, and popular narratives as symbols of power and masculinity."
